# Heart-Disease-Prediction
According to World Health Organization(WHO) 12 million death per year occur worldwide because of heart diseases. Cardio vascular diseases are the reason of half the deaths in United States and in other developed countries. Even after such a significant impacts of heart diseases, we are only able to detect the disease in a person at later stage. Heart disease cases are nearly doubled over the period from 271 million to 523 million from 1990 to 2019, and the deaths due to it are increased by 6.5 million. Early diagnosis of these diseases could lead to some lifestyle changes in the lives of patients which could be beneficial in reducing complications. This project aims to predict the heart disease in its early stage, giving a possibility of developing a hear disease in a patient in early stage, giving them a chance to act on it.
